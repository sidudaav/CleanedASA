This repository contains all the relevant source code and data files for the ASA Statistical Project Competition. Since our raw data would be millions of lines, it is more appropriate to place it here rather than the paper.

The src folder contains all the python and MATLAB files that we used in our project. The data folder contains all the important data that we analyzed.
